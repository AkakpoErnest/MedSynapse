# Data Coin Launch Guide for MedSynapse

Based on your current setup, here's how to launch your data coin on the testnet:

## Current Status

âœ… **MedSynapseConsent Contract**: Already deployed on Polygon Amoy
- Address: `0x43CdcbE93FBd8e9E6fAc33bFD6c1a48B22742e44`
- Explorer: https://amoy.polygonscan.com/address/0x43CdcbE93FBd8e9E6fAc33bFD6c1a48B22742e44

## Launch Options

You have two paths for the data coin:

### Option 1: Use Existing Consent-Based System (Recommended for Quick Start)

Your current setup already tracks contributions through the `MedSynapseConsent` contract. Each data upload creates a consent record, which acts as a "data coin" of sorts.

**What you need to do:**
1. Test uploading data through your frontend
2. The contract will create consent records
3. Each consent = 1 data coin contribution
4. Users can see their balance in the contributor dashboard

**To test it:**
```bash
# Make sure your environment variables are set in frontend/.env
cd frontend
npm run dev
# Then go to http://localhost:3000 and connect your wallet
```

### Option 2: Launch on 1MB.io (Requires Mainnet - Use Later)

**Note:** 1MB.io works on Polygon **mainnet**, not testnet. For development, stick with Option 1.

If you want to launch on 1MB.io for production:
1. Switch MetaMask to Polygon Mainnet
2. Visit https://1MB.io/
3. Create your data coin
4. Copy the contract address
5. Add to `frontend/.env` as `VITE_1MB_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`

**For now, stick with the testnet setup!**

### Option 3: Deploy a Custom ERC-20 Token (More Complex)

If you want your own token contract:

1. **Set up environment:**
   ```bash
   cd contracts
   # Create .env file
   echo "PRIVATE_KEY=your_testnet_private_key" > .env
   echo "AMOY_RPC_URL=https://rpc-amoy.polygon.technology" >> .env
   ```

2. **Deploy the token:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-token.js --network amoy
   ```

3. **Save the contract address** and add it to your frontend environment

## Recommended Next Steps

Since you already have the consent system working, I recommend:

1. **Test the current setup first:**
   - Start your frontend locally
   - Connect a wallet
   - Upload some test data
   - Verify consents are created on-chain
   - Check your contributor dashboard to see the balance

2. **If you need the 1MB.io integration:**
   - Follow Option 2 above
   - It will give you a real data coin on their platform

3. **Optional: Add token transfers:**
   - If you want users to be able to transfer tokens
   - You'll need to deploy the `MedSynapseToken` contract
   - Then update the frontend to use it

## Testing Checklist

Once launched, verify:

- [ ] Data uploads create consent records on-chain
- [ ] Contributor dashboard shows correct balance
- [ ] Contributors can see their consent history
- [ ] Researchers can request access to data
- [ ] Lighthouse integration stores encrypted files
- [ ] Envio indexer shows real-time updates
