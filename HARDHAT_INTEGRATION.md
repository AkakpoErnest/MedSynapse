# Hardhat Integration in MedSynapse

## Overview

Hardhat is used as the smart contract development framework for compiling, testing, and deploying MedSynapse's Solidity contracts to the Ethereum Sepolia testnet.

## Usage in MedSynapse

Hardhat manages the complete smart contract development lifecycle - from writing Solidity code to deploying to blockchain. It compiles the MedSynapseConsent and MedSynapseToken contracts, runs tests, and handles deployment scripts.

### Implementation Locations

**Main Configuration:**
- `contracts/hardhat.config.js` - Hardhat configuration with Sepolia network settings

**Smart Contracts:**
- `contracts/contracts/MedSynapseConsent.sol` - Core consent management contract
- `contracts/contracts/MedSynapseToken.sol` - ERC20 reward token contract  
- `contracts/contracts/DataValidator.sol` - Data validation contract

**Deployment Scripts:**
- `contracts/scripts/deploy.js` - Main deployment script
- `contracts/scripts/deploy-fixed.js` - Fixed deployment script with corrections

**Package Configuration:**
- `contracts/package.json` - Dependencies including Hardhat v3.0.0 and OpenZeppelin contracts

### Key Hardhat Features Used

- **Compilation** - Compiles Solidity contracts to bytecode
- **Testing** - Runs contract tests before deployment
- **Deployment** - Deploys to Sepolia with configured RPC URL
- **Verification** - Verifies contracts on Etherscan for transparency

## Integration Benefits

**Why Hardhat works well for MedSynapse:**
- Fast iteration - Hot reload during development
- Built-in testing framework - Catch bugs before deployment
- Network management - Easy switching between testnets and mainnet
- Deployment automation - Scripts handle the entire process
- Clear error messages - Helpful when debugging contract issues

**Feedback:**
Hardhat has been essential for MedSynapse's contract development. The ability to quickly compile and test contracts locally before deploying to Sepolia significantly sped up development. The network configuration is straightforward, and the built-in Hardhat console made debugging much easier than using raw web3 tools.
