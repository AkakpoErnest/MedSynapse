# AI Integration in MedSynapse

## Overview

MedSynapse uses scikit-learn and custom analytics algorithms to provide intelligent insights for health data analysis, predictive analytics, and anomaly detection. The AI processes real-time blockchain data from Envio to generate actionable recommendations for both contributors and researchers.

## Usage in MedSynapse

The AI system analyzes health data quality, detects anomalies, and provides predictive insights about data demand and research opportunities. It processes uploaded lab results and wearable data using machine learning to identify patterns and flag unusual health metrics.

### Implementation Locations
